# React Leaflet Maps

This project demonstrates the use of **React Leaflet** to create interactive maps with custom markers and polygons, leveraging **GeoJSON** data and OpenStreetMap tiles.

## Features
- **Map with Custom Markers**: Displays geographical points with custom markers. Each marker has a popup with additional information.
- **Map with GeoJSON Polygons**: Displays US states as polygons with color coding based on population density. The polygons are interactive and show tooltips with state names and density.
